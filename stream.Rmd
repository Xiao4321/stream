# Introduction

What differentiates stream mining from typical data mining?  It's the fact that we don't have all the data at the onset.  With typical forms of data mining, we are given a static set of data.  With stream mining, we are given one data point at a time and we do not know with certainty what the next data point will be.



**Definition (Data Stream):**
A *data stream* $d_s = (d_1, d_2, \dots)$ is an ordered, possibly unbounded, continuous sequence of data points generated by some unkown, and not necessarily stationary, stochastic process.

**Examples:**
Data streams may come in the following forms:

1. Medical sensor data including smart watches and exercise bands.
2. Environmental sensor data including smart thermostats.
3. Web click streams from social networking websites.
4. Blogging and microblogging posts.
5. Entries in an operating system's log files.
6. Shazam, 

**Definition (Stream Mining):** 
*Stream mining* is the process of extracting
useful information from a data stream in real-time, as the data becomes
available.

Since the data may be unbounded, the length of the stream may never cease, when
stream mining it is rare to want to store the data.  What is stored instead are
the statistics mind from the data.

Traditional data mining algorithms are not well suited to the evolving and
potentially speed and amount of change. Evaluation of stream mining algorithms
presents a unique challenge as the performance of the algorithm needs to be
evaluated in real-time, and the data may have underlying properties which evolve
over time, so that algorithm may start out performing well but then it may fail
to adapt to the stream. The model's capacity may fail to capture the data as it
evolves.

Since the data is continuously being created and mined, stream mining algorithms
only get to read the data once, unlike static data mining algorithms like
kmeans, EM etc... stream mining algorithms do not read the data multiple times.
How does this affect iterative methods?

Classification can be difficult since new classes may emerge from what were
originally labeled as outliers. One class may divide into two.

# Algorithms

## Classification

Data stream classification is very different from static data classification
since the whole data is never known, so we can not divide the data up into
train, test, and validation data sets.

Adapting to concept drift is key to a successful stream classification
algorithm.


### Performance Measures

#### Kappa

**Definition (Kappa Statistic):**
The *kappa statistic* $\kappa \in (0, 1)$ measures the performance of a data stream classifier by comparing its performance to a random classification algorithm that assigns random class labels to data points.  The kappa statistics is defined below

$$\kappa = {A_{train} - A_{random}\over 1 - A_{random}}$$

where $A_train$ is the accuracy of the classifier being trained and $A_random$ is the accuracy of assigning class labels at random.

#### Temporal Kappa

**Definition (Temporal Kappa Statistic):**
The *temporal kappa statistic* $\kappa_t \in (-\infty, 1)$ measures the tendency for the classifier to be influenced by the temporal ordering

$$\kappa_{t} = {A_{train} - A_{persistent}\over 1 - A_{persistent}}$$

where $A_{persistent}$ is the classifier which assigns the same label to data point $t+1$ as $t$ was labelled.

## Clustering

Number of clusters changes over time, and the boundaries of the clusters
themselves also change as new data arrives.

### Performance Measures

##### Completeness

**Definition (Completeness):**
*Completeness* $\kappa \in (0, 1)$ measures the performance of a data stream classifier by comparing its performance to a random classification algorithm that assigns random class labels to data points.  The kappa statistics is defined below

$$\kappa = {A_{train} - A_{random}\over 1 - A_{random}}$$

where $A_train$ is the accuracy of the classifier being trained and $A_random$ is the accuracy of assigning class labels at random.


# Specific Algorithms

### Stream (Available on CRAN)

```{R}
stream <- DSD_Gaussians(k=3, noise=0)
sample <- DSC_Sample(k=20)
update(sample, stream, 500)
sample
```

```{R}
kmeans <- DSC_Kmeans(k=3)
recluster(kmeans, sample)
plot(kmeans, stream, type="both")
```
