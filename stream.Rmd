# Introduction

cluster,
classification,
offline analysis


What differentiates stream mining from typical data mining?  It's the fact that we don't have all the data at the onset.  With typical forms of data mining, we are given a static set of data.  With stream mining, data points arrive one at a time and we do not know with certainty what the next data point will be, and in most applications, the stream is of infinite length.

# Issues Unique to Stream Mining

Data streams may deliver points rapidly and, depending on the application, it may be desirable to process the incoming data right away.  It may also be the case that since the data may be infinite, there is no storage, meaning the data can not be iterated over, which makes many traditional algorithms inappropriate for this kind of data mining.

# Definitions 

**Definition (Data Stream):**
A *data stream* $d_s = (d_1, d_2, \dots)$ is an ordered, possibly unbounded, continuous sequence of data points generated by some unknown, and not necessarily stationary, stochastic process.

**Examples:**
Data streams may come in the following forms:

1. Medical sensor data including smart watches and exercise bands.
2. Environmental sensor data including smart thermostats.
3. Web click streams from social networking websites.
4. Blogging and micro-blogging posts.
5. Entries in an operating system's log files.
6. Music classification programs such as "Shazam".

**Definition (Stream Mining):** 
*Stream mining* is the process of extracting
useful information from a data stream in real-time, as the data becomes
available.

Since the data may be unbounded, the length of the stream may never cease, when
stream mining it is rare to want to store the data.  What is stored instead are
the statistics mind from the data.

Traditional data mining algorithms are not well suited to the evolving and
potentially speed and amount of change. Evaluation of stream mining algorithms
presents a unique challenge as the performance of the algorithm needs to be
evaluated in real-time, and the data may have underlying properties which evolve
over time, so that algorithm may start out performing well but then it may fail
to adapt to the stream. The model's capacity may fail to capture the data as it
evolves.

Since the data is continuously being created and mined, stream mining algorithms
only get to read the data once, unlike static data mining algorithms like
kmeans, EM etc... stream mining algorithms do not read the data multiple times.
How does this affect iterative methods?

# Types of Algorithms

## Classification

Data stream classification is very different from static data classification
since the whole data is never known, so we can not divide the data up into
train, test, and validation data sets.

Classification can be difficult since new classes may emerge from what were
originally labeled as outliers. One class may divide into two.

Adapting to concept drift is key to a successful stream classification
algorithm.

## Clustering

Number of clusters changes over time, and the boundaries of the clusters
themselves also change as new data arrives.

Clustering, the assignment of data points to groups such that points within each group are more similar than points in groups. For static data sets methods, which need access to all data points are unsuitable for data stream. We use a two-stage online/offline approach:

### Online

Summarize the data using a set of $k’$ micro-clusters, which are representatives for sets of similar data points and are created using a single pass over the data. Micro- clusters are typically represented by cluster centers, density and additional statistics. Each new data point is assigned to its closest micro-cluster, and if this data point cannot be assigned to an existing micro- cluster, then a new cluster is created. The algorithm may also keep the number of micro- clusters at a manageable size or the information up-to-date by deleting or merging micro-clusters.

### Offline

Use conventional clustering algorithm by regarding micro-clusters as pseudo-points since the offline part is usually not time critical. That means the $k’$ micro-clusters are reclustered into $k$ ($k << k'$) final clusters named macro-cluster.

# Demonstration 1: Clustering Mixture of Gaussian Distributions

We worked extensively with the `stream` package from `CRAN`.

```{R eval=F, echo=T}
stream <- DSD_Gaussians(k=3, noise=0)
kmeans <- DSC_Kmeans(k=3)
for (i in 1:100) {
  sample <- DSC_Sample(k=100)
  update(sample, stream, 100)
  recluster(kmeans, sample)
  png(paste("gauss", i, "png", sep="."))
  plot(kmeans, stream, type="both", xlim=c(0, 1), ylim=c(0, 1))
  dev.off()
  Sys.sleep(1)
}
```

# Demonstration 2: Clustering with Concept Drift

To illustrate the phenomena of concept drift, we found the following toy data set, called `movingSquares` which contains points from four uniform distributions over square regions of $\mathbb{R}^2$.  The concept in question is the center point of the square.  As we play the stream, we can see they squares moving left and right in the plane.  If we use `kmeans` to find the center of each square, we have to adapt as new points become available.  In other words, the center of each square is not static, and we have to update the `kmeans` estimate, repeatedly.  The following code and animation illustrate concept drift and our method of adapting to it.

```{R eval=F, echo=T}
data.location <- "./Data/driftDatasets/artificial/movingSquares"
data <- read_delim(paste(data.location, "movingSquares.data", sep="/"),
                   col_names=F, delim = " ")
labels <- read_csv(paste(data.location, "movingSquares.labels", sep="/"), 
                   col_names=F) %>% 
  rename("Labels" = X1)
moving.squares <- cbind(data, labels)

kmeans <- DSC_Kmeans(k=4)
stream <- DSD_Memory(scale(moving.squares[,1:2], scale=T, center=T), 
                     class=moving.squares$Labels)

i <- 1
while (TRUE) {
  i <- i + 1
  sample <- DSC_Sample(k=40)
  update(sample, stream, 100)
  recluster(kmeans, sample)
  plot(kmeans, stream, type="both", xlim=c(-3, 3), ylim=c(-3, 3))
  Sys.sleep(time=0.1)
}
```


# Demonstration 3: Saving Streaming Data for Offline Use

Many data-centric businesses offer APIs to access their data. Twitter for
instance has an API, but one must request access to the API. We applied for
access, but have not heard back from Twitter. We then decided to go with the `R`
package `quantmod`, which has an interface to access real time stock prices. The
following code-snippet runs an infinite loop to grab a quote from the General
Electric stock price.  GE was chosen because it was listed as a relatively
volatile stock compared with other stocks.  The code grabs a price every 15
seconds and adds it to a plot.

```{R echo=T, eval=F}
i = 0
plot(c(), xlim=c(0, 100), ylim=c(0, 1000), xlab="X", ylab="Y", main="Stocks")
while (TRUE) {
    quotes <- getQuote("GE;GOOG;AAPL")
    points(c(i, quotes$Last), pch=20, col=i)
    Sys.sleep(time=1)
    i <- i + 1
}
```

# Demonstration 4: Streaming Queries

The following code will obtain the current stock price for general electric for 1000 iterations, each iteration separated by 15 seconds.  Once we have collected 1000 stock prices, we can later do offline analysis.  This demononstrates a method for collected a finite, discrete subset of a continuous and infinite length stream.  Notice the use of checkpoints, in case the program fails, the internet connection dies or the user of the script needs to stop it for some reason.

```{R eval=F}
dir.create("./checkpoints")
my.stocks <- tibble("Index", "Stock Price")
i = 0
while (i < 1000) {
  i <- i + 1
  quotes <- getQuote("GE")
  my.stocks <- rbind(my.stocks, c(date(), quotes$Last))
  if (i %% 10 == 0) {
    write_csv(interesting.points, 
              paste("./checkpoints/my.stocks.checkpoint.", i, ".csv", sep=""))
  }
  Sys.sleep(time=15)
}
write_csv(my.stocks, "./my.stocks.csv")
```

## Filtering a data stream

This ties in with the fact that the stream may be of uncountable cardinality and we are only interested in a very small subset that satisfy some criteria.

We can modify the above example, to record the time indices when the data points satisfy some criteria.  For example, we can look at the historical high and low for `GE`'s stock price, and we can set up an alert for when the stock goes above or below a certain value.  From looking at the NASDAQ's website, it looks like the average price of `GE` has been around \$7.50 for the past few days (as of Nov 30th).  The following code will record the time and date whenever the stock price leave the interval $[7.40, 7.60]$ and then export the `tibble` as a `csv`.

```{R echo=T, eval=F}
dir.create("./checkpoints")
interesting.points <- tibble("Index", "Stock Price")
i = 0
while (TRUE) {
  i <- i + 1
  quotes <- getQuote("GE")
  if (quotes$Last < 7.40 || quotes$Last > 7.60) {
    interesting.points <- rbind(interesting.points, c(date(), quotes$Last))
  }
  if (i %% 10 == 0) {
    write_csv(interesting.points, 
              paste("./checkpoints/interesting.points.checkpoint.", i, ".csv", sep=""))
  }
  Sys.sleep(time=15)
}
write_csv(interesting.points, "./interesting.points.csv")
```

I will have R watch the stream, and record values at each time step.  I can ask R to record the average value for every (let's say) 40 points. That one thing we can do with a stream.

```{R, echo=T, eval=F}
dir.create("./checkpoints")
points <- c()
while (TRUE) {
  points <- rbind(points, getQuote("GE"))
  if (length(points) %% 10 == 0) {
    cat(date(), "Mean:", mean(points))
  }
  Sys.sleep(time=15)
}
```

We can perform standing queries; we can ask `R` to keep track of the maximum or minimum values of the stock and update those values as new points become available.

```{R echo=T, eval=F}
min <- 0
max <- 0
while (TRUE) {
  quotes <- getQuote("GE")
  max <- ifelse(quotes$Last > max, quotes$Last, max)
  min <- ifelse(quotes$Last < min, quotes$Last, min)
  if (i %% 10 == 0) {
    cat("Max: ", max, ", Min: ", min, sep="")
  }
  Sys.sleep(time=15)
}
```

# Histogram to record number of recurrences of a specific element.

We can make a markov chain for a finite alphabet and we can generate a histogram for each letter.

TODO : Estimating moments?

```{R echo=T, eval=F}
letters <- c("A", "C", "G", "T")
A <- matrix(c(0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 
              0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 
              0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 
              0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.4), nrow=4, ncol=4, byrow=T)

initial.state <- c(0, 0, 1, 0)

P <- A %*% initial.state

genome <- c()
tally <- list("A"=0, "C"=0, "G"=0, "T"=0)
for (i in 1:10000) {
  state <- sample(letters, 1, prob=P)
  tally[[state]] = tally[[state]] + 1
  P <- A %*% (state == letters)
  genome <- c(genome, state)
  if (i %% 10 == 0) {
    barplot(c(tally$A, tally$C, tally$G, tally$T), names.arg=letters) 
  }
  Sys.sleep(1)
}
```
# Demonstration Finance

```{R, eval=F}
if (!file.exists("./hist.png")) {
  files <- list.files("./Data/Big/Stocks/")
  sizes <- list()
  for (file in files) {
    sizes[gsub('.{7}$', '', file)] <- dim(read_csv(paste("./Data/Big/Stocks", file, sep="/")))[1]
  }
  png("hist.png")
  hist(unlist(sizes), labels=T)
  dev.off()
}
```

![Histogram]("./hist.png")

```{R, eval=F}
if (!file.exists("./big.csv")) {
  historical.stock.data <- data.frame()
  for (file in files) {
    stock.data <- read_csv(paste("./Data/Big/Stocks", file, sep = "/"))
    if (dim(stock.data)[1] == 3201) {
      new <- stock.data %>%
        mutate("Company Name" = gsub('.{7}$', '', file),
               "Difference Day" = abs(Open - Close),
               "Difference Value" = abs(High - Close)) %>%
        filter(Date >= "2005-02-25" & Date <= "2017-11-10")
      historical.stock.data <- rbind(historical.stock.data, new)
    }
  }
  write_csv(historical.stock.data, path="./big.csv")
}

## Stocks that I like based on closing value or volatility
closing.value <- c("sgy", "mkl", "ghc", "wwr", "blk", "clsn", "isrg", "shpg", "lll")
volatility <- c("svra", "abio", "sgy", "scon", "tdw", "nvr", "bh", "ghc", "crs")

if (!file.exists("./sample.csv")) {
  stocks <- read_csv("./big.csv") %>% mutate(Date = as.factor(Date))
  levels(stocks$Date) <- 1:length(levels(stocks$Date))
  stocks %>% mutate(Date = as.numeric(Date))
sample <- (function(x, df) subset(df, `Company Name` %in% x)) (volatility, stocks)
write_csv(sample, path="./sample.csv")
}
```

## Animated Demo of Stream

To demonstrate stream clustering, we'll want to pick out some stocks that are different from each other.

```{R, eval=F, echo=T}
reset.stream <- function(Variable)
{
  DSD_Memory(ordered %>% select(Date, Variable), class=ordered$`Company Name`)
}

sample <- read_csv("./sample.csv")
ordered <- sample[order(sample$Date),] %>% 
  mutate(`Company Name` = as.factor(`Company Name`))
simulated.stream <- reset.stream("Close")
```

## Animated Demo of Stream

```{R, echo=T, eval=F}
make.animation <- function(Variable, df)
{
  i <- 1
  while (i < dim(df)[1]) {
    i <- i + 9
    my.points <- df[i:(i+9),]
    plot(c(), xlab="Day", ylab=Variable, xlim=c(0, dim(df)[1]/9), ylim=c(0, 2000))
    points(x=my.points$Date, y=my.points[[Variable]], col=my.points$`Company Name`)
  }
}
make.animation("Close", ordered)

simulated.stream <- reset.stream("Close")
animate_data(simulated.stream, horizon = 9, n = 3201*9, wait = .1, plot.args = list(shared=TRUE), loop=TRUE)
```

![GIF animate]("./Animations/gauss.gif")

From the large, concatenated dataset, we can create a simulated data stream and use the kmeans algorithm built into `streams`.
## TODO : find the labels of the points that belong to the clusters.
```{R, echo=T, eval=F}
stream <- reset.stream("Close")
kmeans <- DSC_Kmeans(k=2)
assignments <- c()
for (i in 1:100) {
  my.sample <- DSC_Sample(k=40)
  update(my.sample, stream, 40)
  recluster(kmeans, my.sample)
  for (i in 1:length(kmeans$RObj$assignment)) {
    assignments <- c(assignments, kmeans$RObj$assignment[[i]]) 
  }
  plot(kmeans, stream, n=i*40, type="both", xlim=c(0, 28809), ylim=c(0, 5000))
  Sys.sleep(1)
}
```

# Offline Analysis of Stock Market Data

```{R}
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(zoo)
library(factoextra)
library(NbClust)
library(rowr)
library(fpc)
```

# Add a new column called clustname, which shows the each stock's cluster.

```{R}
sample <- read_csv("./sample.csv")
str(sample)
head(sample)
sample.slct=select(sample,Date, Close,`Difference Value`,`Company Name`)
head(sample.slct)
kms=kmeans(sample.slct %>% select(Close,`Difference Value`), center=5)
sample.slct$clustname<-kms$cluster 
sample$clustname=kms$cluster
```

####Summarize data based on cluster

```{r}
summary.clust <- sample %>% 
  group_by(clustname) %>% 
  summarize(closemean=mean(Close,na.rm = T),diffmean=mean(`Difference Day`), volumemean=mean(Volume))
summary.clust
```

####Plot the difference value against close price, which seperated by 5 clusters.

```{r}
plot(sample.slct$'Difference Value', sample.slct$Close, col = sample.slct$clustname)

ggplot(data=sample,aes(y=Close,x=`Difference Value`,color=clustname)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(clustname~., scale="free") 

ggplot(data=sample,aes(y=Close,x=`Difference Value`,color=clustname)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(clustname~., scale="free") 
```

####Plot the difference value against close price of each company

```{r}

ggplot(data=sample,aes(y=Close,x=Open,color=`Company Name`)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(`Company Name`~., scale="free") 
```


####Plot the difference value against close price of companies in cluster 1

```{r}
clust1=filter(sample, clustname=="1")
ggplot(data=clust1,aes(y=Close,x=Open,color=`Company Name`)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(`Company Name`~., scale="free") 

```

####Time series


```{r}
close=select(sample, Date, Close,`Company Name`)
head(close)
abio=filter(close,`Company Name`=="abio")#1 cluster
svra=filter(close,`Company Name`=="svra")#1
tdw=filter(close,`Company Name`=="tdw")#3
nvr=filter(close,`Company Name`=="nvr")#3
bh=filter(close,`Company Name`=="bh")
crs=filter(close,`Company Name`=="crs")
ghc=filter(close,`Company Name`=="ghc")
scon=filter(close,`Company Name`=="scon")
sgy=filter(close,`Company Name`=="sgy")

head(abio)
plot(abio$Date,abio$Close,type="l")#time series
plot(svra$Date,svra$Close,type="l")
plot(tdw$Date,tdw$Close,type="l")
plot(nvr$Date,nvr$Close,type="l")


```

####Plot correlation

The correlation coefficient is used to measure both the degree and direction of the correlation
between any two stocks. It ranges from -1 and 1. It will hedge your bets by selecting stocks with a negative coefficient so that if one stock fails, the other is likely to get a boost. When stocks have a correlation coefficient of 0,it means that they are as likely to move differently as they are to move together, making them unpredictable. However, this also means there is less likelihood that
many noncorrelated stocks will fail simultaneously.

Choosing a variety of stocks with different degrees and directions of correlation is one of the most common and effective diversification strategies. The result is a portfolio that displays a general upward trend, since, at any given time, at least one security should be doing well even if others are failing.

```{r}
new=data.frame(abio$Close,bh$Close,crs$Close,ghc$Close,nvr$Close,scon$Close,sgy$Close,svra$Close,tdw$Close)
head(new)
cor_matrix = cor(new)
cor_matrix

clustcor <- kmeans(cor_matrix, centers=3)
par(cex=0.9, family="sans")
plotcluster(cor_matrix, clustcor$cluster)
```


#### Fiting data with 3rd polynomial function

```{r}
abio=filter(close,`Company Name`=="abio")%>%
  filter(Date<1000)
dim(abio)

po=lm(abio$Close~poly(abio$Date,degree = 5, raw=T))


p <-ggplot(abio, aes(x=abio$Date, y=abio$Close)) +
  geom_point()+
  stat_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE, fill=NA,
              formula=y ~ poly(x, 5, raw=TRUE),colour="red")

p
```
