# Introduction

What differentiates stream mining from typical data mining?  It's the fact that we don't have all the data at the onset.  With typical forms of data mining, we are given a static set of data.  With stream mining, we are given one data point at a time and we do not know with certainty what the next data point will be.



**Definition (Data Stream):**
A *data stream* $d_s = (d_1, d_2, \dots)$ is an ordered, possibly infinite, not necessarily countable, sequence of data points generated by some unkown, and not necessarily stationary, stochastic process.

**Examples:**
Data streams may come in the following forms:

1. Live 

**Definition (Stream Mining):** 
*Stream mining* is the process of extracting useful information from a data stream.

The data stream may 

# Theory

## Existing Algorithms

### Stream (Available on CRAN)

```{R}
stream <- DSD_Gaussians(k=3, noise=0)
sample <- DSC_Sample(k=20)
update(sample, stream, 500)
sample
```

```{R}
kmeans <- DSC_Kmeans(k=3)
recluster(kmeans, sample)
plot(kmeans, stream, type="both")
```
